This project is a webapp created using Flask and SQLAlchemy in 2014. It is for a card-and-board game created by my friend, Alex Durkee. The game itself draws heavily from the Pokemon and Digimon franchises, including additions, subtractions, and alterations. The game was made for strictly personal use, with up to 21 players, playing in person, and has never been distributed
nor commercialized. This app is not that game, however, and is being made available on Github. Credit for its development is given primarily to myself, Javier Cueto. However, Alex Durkee is credited as well, for the conceptual design
of most of the pages, as well as for helping to fix bugs in the html and css at various points during development.

The purpose of this application is to store information concerning "mons", track player progress, and make everything available 24/7. As the material it draws on includes thousands of mons across both series, and requires hundreds
of hours to complete even with only four to six players, it has seen much usage and had had most of its bugs ironed out. However, due to a lack of time, minor bugs in its presentation across Chrome, Firefox, and Internet
Explorer were never resolved. In addition, no mobile version was created. The best performing browser was Chrome, although the application was sufficiently functional across all browsers for our purposes.

There is not enough here for a useful application. A full version of the application is currently online, please contact the author for the url.

Sidenote: The game and app were both created as club projects for Amherst College's Custom Game Club, of which Alex Durkee and I were co-presidents. Because this application was created during my second semester of Intro to Programming, and entirely without professional help (beyond internet resources), I consider it my first real-world programming project, and ask that it be evalutated with that in mind. Thank you.
